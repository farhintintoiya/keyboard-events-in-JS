# Keyboard Event in JavaScript

This is a small practice of learning **keyboard events in JavaScript**.  
It demonstrates how `keydown` events work and how to access `event.key` and `event.code`.

The goal of this project is **learning and understanding**, not building a full application.

## 📌 What is the concept?

- Takes keyboard input from an `<input>` field
- Detects which key is pressed
- Displays:
  - `event.key` gives the actual character or key
  - `event.code` gives the physical key on the keyboard
- It manipulates the DOM selection using `querySelector`
